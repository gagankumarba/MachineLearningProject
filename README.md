Supervised Machine Learning Tasks on Statlog (Vehicle Silhouettes) Data Set
Purpose/Use of the task: The dataset is taken from real-world images of vehicles and can 
be used to train machine-learning models to categorize various kinds of vehicles based 
on their silhouettes. This has real-world uses in industries like transit and surveillance.
Additionally, the dataset's 18 unique features, each of which describes a different aspect 
of the car silhouette, make it possible to teach machine learning models to recognize
multiple patterns and make accurate predictions.
● Learning tasks used: 
 Decision Trees
 Instance-based learning
 Neural networks
 Bayesian Learning
 Model Ensembles
● Performance measure: Accuracy and Precision shall be used to measure performance. 
Accuracy calculates the proportion of instances that are properly classified. It can be 
determined by dividing the number of correctly predicted labels by the overall number of 
true labels. Precision calculates the ratio of true positive results to all positive results. It 
can be determined by dividing the number of true positives by the total of true positives 
and erroneous positives. The confusion matrix gives a holistic interpretation of the 
performance of the learning tasks.
